# Student Course Management and Learning Progress Tracking System

## Project Overview

The **Student Course Management and Learning Progress Tracking System** is a full-stack web application designed to streamline academic course enrollment and learning management. The system allows students to create accounts, browse available courses, enroll in courses, access course materials, track their learning progress, and receive updates regarding their courses.

The application also provides administrators with tools to manage students, courses, enrollments, and progress reports.

This project demonstrates key concepts in Full Stack Web Development, including frontend development, backend APIs, database management, authentication, deployment, and application security.

## Problem Statement

In many educational institutions, students face challenges such as:

- Finding available courses
- Registering for courses efficiently
- Monitoring learning progress
- Accessing course information in one place
- Tracking completed and pending modules

Similarly, administrators often encounter difficulties in managing course enrollments and monitoring student performance.

This system addresses these challenges by providing a centralized web-based platform for academic course management and progress tracking.

## Backend (Express) structure and middleware

```
backend/
├── config/        environment + allowed resources
├── controllers/   request handlers
├── middleware/    notFound, errorHandler, courseValidation, resourceValidation
├── routes/        /api routes
├── services/      JSON Server (mock-api) calls
├── utils/         asyncHandler, AppError
├── .env           PORT=3001, MOCK_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
└── server.js
```

Run: `cd backend && npm install && npm run dev` (keep `mock-api` running on port 5000).
Check: `http://localhost:3001/api/health`
Middleware order in `server.js`: cors → json → urlencoded → morgan → routes → notFound → errorHandler.

## Deployment

### Live Application

- **Frontend:** https://your-frontend.vercel.app
- **Backend:** https://your-backend.onrender.com
- **API Health:** https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/health

> Replace the placeholders above after deploying. Only state that production tests have passed after you have actually run them.

### Technology Stack

- React, React Router, Axios (`react-frontend/`)
- Node.js and Express (`backend/`)
- MongoDB and Mongoose
- JWT and bcryptjs
- Socket.IO
- helmet, express-validator, express-rate-limit, morgan

### Features

- Student registration and login (passwords hashed with bcrypt, minimum 12 characters)
- Forgotten passwords are reset by the administrator (Manage Students page); students then change the temporary password under Change Password
- Admin CSV export of students (name, email, student ID, department, registration date; passwords are never exported because only hashes are stored)
- Optional emailed reset link (`POST /auth/forgot-password`, `/auth/reset-password`), available in the API but not used by the Forgot Password page
- JWT authentication (HS256, 1 hour by default)
- Admin and student role-based access
- Student and Course CRUD (admin-managed students, public course catalogue)
- Student profile retrieval and update
- Course enrollment, unenrollment (history kept as `withdrawn`) and re-enrollment
- Learning progress tracking
- Real-time chat and notifications over Socket.IO, with persisted history
- Centralized validation, error handling, rate limiting and security headers
- Responsive frontend

### Project structure

```
backend/    Express API  (config, controllers, middleware, models, routes, validators, scripts)
react-frontend/   Vite + React app (pages, components, api clients, legacy page scripts)
docs/       database-schema.md, postman/ collection
mock-api/   Original JSON Server data (only used as the seed source)
frontend/   Original static HTML version
```

### Local Setup

1. Clone the GitHub repository.
2. Start MongoDB locally (or create a free MongoDB Atlas cluster).
3. Backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env        # then edit .env
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"   # paste into JWT_SECRET
   npm run seed                # imports the 12 sample courses
   ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com ADMIN_PASSWORD='a-long-password-12+' npm run create-admin
   npm start                   # http://localhost:3001
   ```
4. Frontend:
   ```bash
   cd react-frontend
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env        # VITE_API_URL and VITE_SOCKET_URL
   npm run dev                 # http://localhost:5173
   ```

Administrator accounts cannot be created through public registration; use `npm run create-admin`.

Forgotten admin password: run `RESET_EMAIL=... npm run reset-password` (PowerShell: `$env:RESET_EMAIL="..."` first) from the `backend` folder. It prints a new random password unless you set `RESET_PASSWORD`.

### Environment variables

Backend (`backend/.env`, never commit): `PORT`, `NODE_ENV`, `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`, `CLIENT_URL` (comma-separated list of allowed frontend origins; used for CORS and Socket.IO), `FRONTEND_URL` (address used inside reset emails), `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, `EMAIL_FROM` (email sending; for Gmail use an App password). Without SMTP settings, in development the reset link is printed in the backend terminal; in production email is required.

Frontend (`react-frontend/.env`): `VITE_API_URL` (e.g. `http://localhost:3001/api/v1`), `VITE_SOCKET_URL` (backend origin, no `/api/v1`).

### API summary

All routes are under `/api/v1` (plus `GET /api/health`).

| Area | Endpoints |
| --- | --- |
| Auth | `POST /auth/register`, `POST /auth/login`, `POST /auth/forgot-password`, `POST /auth/reset-password` |
| Students (admin) | `GET/POST /students`, `GET /students/export`, `POST /students/:id/reset-password`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /students/:id` |
| Courses | `GET /courses`, `GET /courses/:id` (public); `POST /courses`, `PUT/DELETE /courses/:id` (admin) |
| Admins (admin) | `GET /admins`, `POST /admins/:id/reset-password` (not for your own account) |
| Profile | `GET/PUT /profile`, `PUT /profile/password` |
| Enrollments | `POST /enrollments`, `GET /enrollments/me`, `DELETE /enrollments/:courseId` (student); `GET /enrollments` (admin) |
| Progress (student) | `GET /progress/me`, `PUT /progress/:courseId` |
| Messages | `GET /messages/contacts`, `GET /messages/:userId` |
| Notifications | `GET /notifications`, `PATCH /notifications/:id/read` |

Socket.IO events (JWT required in `auth.token`): client sends `send_message`; server emits `receive_message` and `new_notification`.

### Deployment steps

**MongoDB Atlas** - create a cluster, a database user with a strong password, allow your hosting provider's network access, copy the connection string.

**Backend on Render** - New Web Service, select the `backend` root directory, Node runtime, build command `npm install` (use `npm ci` once you have committed a fresh `package-lock.json`), start command `npm start`. Environment variables: `NODE_ENV=production`, `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1h`, `CLIENT_URL=https://your-frontend.vercel.app`. Render provides `PORT`. After the first deploy run `npm run seed` and `npm run create-admin` once (Render shell, or locally pointed at the Atlas URI).

**Frontend on Vercel** - import the repository, root directory `react-frontend`, Vite preset, build `npm run build`, output `dist`. Environment variables: `VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/v1`, `VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com`. Redeploy after changing them. `vercel.json` rewrites all routes to `index.html` so refreshing nested routes works.

### Testing

Import `docs/postman/edubloom.postman_collection.json` into Postman and run the folders in order (41 requests covering registration, login, 400/401/403/404/409 cases, CRUD, enrollment, progress, notifications). Repeat the wrong-password login 11 times to confirm the 429 rate limit. Browser checks: register, log in, browse and manage courses, open `/messages` in two browser profiles to confirm real-time chat and notifications, then log out and confirm the session is cleared.

### Known limitations

- The existing HTML/JS pages still keep **enrollment, progress and certificate data in the browser's localStorage**; the matching REST endpoints exist and are ready, but those pages have not been migrated to call them.
- The admin registration page cannot create real admins (by design); use `npm run create-admin`.
- JWT is stored in `sessionStorage` (educational choice; consider HttpOnly cookies for production).
- Socket.IO messaging allows any signed-in user to message any other user; add recipient rules and shared rate-limit storage before a public launch.
